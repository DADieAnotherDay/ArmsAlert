# 🔫 Weapon Detection Tool using Python & OpenCV

This project is a real-time weapon detection system built with Python, OpenCV, and pre-trained deep learning models. It aims to detect weapons (such as guns or knives) in video streams or camera feeds to assist in security surveillance applications.

## 📌 Features

- 🔍 Real-time weapon detection using webcam or video
- 🧠 Pre-trained deep learning model for object recognition
- 🎥 Live video stream analysis with bounding boxes
- 💬 Alerts printed to console or log when a weapon is detected
- 🖥️ Lightweight, easy to run on any machine with Python installed

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow / PyTorch (optional depending on your model)
- Pre-trained models (YOLO / MobileNet SSD / Haar Cascade)

## 🚀 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weapon-detector.git
cd weapon-detector
pip install -r requirements.txt
